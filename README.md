# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is solved in a java programming language.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Problem Number/Name**: Each problem has its own directory named after the problem's name or number.
  - **Solution Files**: Inside each problem directory, you'll find the solution file(s) with the code.
  - **README.md**: This file contains a brief explanation of the problem and the approach taken for solving it.
